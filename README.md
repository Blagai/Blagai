### Hey there!

I wasn't really active in the open-source scene up until now, and I'm mostly a game developer.
Lately, I've been interested in some open-source projects and other things beyond just game development, so I've started working on them and checking them out!

I mostly program with C# and C++, because they are used in Unity and Unreal.

Most of the tools I make are because I'm lazy and need to automate my shit.
Other stuff I make is either because I want it to exist and it doesn't, or out of boredom.

If you want to help me with anything or have any cool ideas hit me up on Discord @chloethebitch
