### Hey there!

I'm Chloe, I wasn't really active in the open-source scene up until now, and I'm mostly a game developer.
Lately, I've been interested in some open-source projects and other things beyond just game development, so I've started working on them and checking them out!

I mostly program with C# and C++, because they are used in Unity and Unreal.
